# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

## Introduction

This notebook presents an analysis of the Cyclistic bike-share data. The dataset contains information about bike rides taken by customers over a certain period of time. The goal of this analysis is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.Also using the data to help the company make strategic decisions for the future.

## Data Source

The datset used in this case is Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data , which is publicly available at this [link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) . The data has been made available Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

### Data Overview

The dataset consists of the following columns:

- `trip_id`: Unique identifier for each trip
- `start_time`: Start time of the trip
- `end_time`: End time of the trip
- `duration`: Duration of the trip in minutes
- `usertype`: Type of user (customer or subscriber)
- `gender`: Gender of the user (male, female)
- `from_station_name`: Name of the station where the trip started
- `to_station_name`: Name of the station where the trip ended

## Prerequisites

To run this analysis, you will need the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Analysis Steps

The analysis includes descriptive statistics, such as mean and median trip durations, as well as visualizations to explore patterns and trends in the data. The analysis also examines the popularity of stations, user types, and user demographics.

- Data Cleaning: The dataset will be cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Various visualizations and statistical analysis will be performed to understand the distribution of variables and identify any interesting patterns or trends.

- Key Findings: The main findings and insights from the analysis will be summarized and presented.

## Results 

The analysis provides insights into various aspects of the bike sharing data, including:

- Trip duration statistics
- User type distribution
- User demographics by age and gender
- Popular stations and their usage by user type

The results can be used to understand user behavior, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions for bike sharing programs.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, this analysis of the bike sharing data provides valuable insights into various aspects of the bike sharing program.

Overall, this analysis provides insights that can be used to enhance the bike sharing program, improve user experience, and make data-driven decisions for future planning and expansion.
